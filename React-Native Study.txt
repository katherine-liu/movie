# The Basic

*Props
    Your own components can also use props.
    This lets you make single component that is used in many different places in your app,
    which slightly different properties in each place.

    Example:
    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    import { AppRegistry, Text, View } from 'react-native';

    class Greeting extends Component {
        render() {
            return (
                <Text>Hello {this.props.name}!</Text>
            );
        }
    }

    class LotsOfGreetings extends Component {
        render() {
            return (
                <View style={{alignItems: 'center'}}>
                    <Greeting name='Rexxar' />
                    <Greeting name='Jaina' />
                    <Greeting name='Valeera' />
                </View>
            );
        }
    }

    AppRegistry.registerComponent('LotsOfGreetings', () => LotsOfGreetings);

*State
    There are two types of data that control a component: props and state.
    props are set by the parent and they are fixed throughout the lifetime of a component.
    For data is going to change, we have to use state.

    1. you need to initialize state in the constructor and then call setState when you want to change it.
